        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Dong Po Rou (东坡肉) is a traditional dish of braised pork belly, supposedly created by Su Dong Po (January 8, 1037 – August 24, 1101), a famous writer, poet, painter, calligrapher, pharmacologist, gastronome, and statesman of the Song dynasty. Over the centuries, this Braised Pork Belly Dong Po Rou dish has become very popular, and once you taste it, you’ll know why.

        At a huge rummage sale I went to recently, I found these cute little clay pots that you see in the photos, and I knew it was time to make this braised pork belly (as it is often served in these kinds of clay pots at fancier restaurants in China). Can you picture this Dong Po Rou being served at a dinner party or family gathering? I think that would be pretty impressive! And believe me when I tell you…if you know how to turn on the stove, you will know how to make this dish. The whole cooking process just involves simmering (and/or steaming). The pork belly soaks up all the great flavors while simmering, and it melts in your mouth without being greasy.</p>
