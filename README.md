# odin-recipes
This is a project for The Odin Project(TOP)
This focuses on developing my html skills(no css)
*Note* this is not quality work. From https://dev.to/theodinproject/learning-code-f56 where they touched on using the most from TOP, it's important to not focus too much on the foundation projects, exept the capstone.
